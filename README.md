## IDEA TITLE: AI-Powered Inclusive Fitness Companion

### Proposed Solution

- An AI-powered fitness assistant using MediaPipe for pose estimation and workout counting
- Real-time AI correction based on body angles, provided through speech and text
- Features weekly rankings and giveaways to encourage consistent participation
- Allows progress sharing within the app's social network

Innovation:
- Combines pose estimation, real-time feedback, and social features
- Inclusive design for users with visual or hearing impairments
- Gamification elements to boost motivation and adherence

## TECHNICAL APPROACH

Technologies:
- Frontend: React Native for cross-platform mobile development
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- AI: TensorFlow.js, MediaPipe for pose estimation
- Database: MongoDB
- Cloud: AWS for scalable infrastructure

Methodology:
1. User registration and profile creation
2. Workout selection and difficulty setting
3. Camera-based pose estimation using MediaPipe
4. Real-time form correction using angle analysis
5. Rep counting and workout completion tracking
6. Progress data storage and analysis
7. Social sharing and leaderboard updates
